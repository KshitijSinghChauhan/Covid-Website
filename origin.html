            <p> By the end of 2019, WHO was informed by the Chinese government about several cases of pneumonia with unfamiliar etiology. 
                The outbreak was initiated from the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan city of China and rapidly infected more than 50 peoples.
                The live animals are frequently sold at the Hunan seafood market such as bats, frogs, snakes, birds, marmots and rabbits .
            </p>
            <p>   
                On 12 January 2020, the National Health Commission of China released further details about the epidemic, suggested viral pneumonia . 
                From the sequence-based analysis of isolates from the patients, the virus was identified as a novel coronavirus.
                Moreover, the genetic sequence was also provided for the diagnosis of viral infection.
            </p>
            <P>
                Initially, it was suggested that the patients infected with Wuhan coronavirus induced pneumonia in China may have visited the seafood market where live animals were sold or may have used infected animals or birds as a source of food.
                However, further investigations revealed that some individuals contracted the infection even with no record of visiting the seafood market.
               <br>
                These observations indicated a human to the human spreading capability of this virus, which was subsequently reported in more than 100 countries in the world.
                The human to the human spreading of the virus occurs due to close contact with an infected person, exposed to coughing, sneezing, respiratory droplets or aerosols.
                These aerosols can penetrate the human body (lungs) via inhalation through the nose or mouth.

                <strong>Fig.</strong> The key reservoirs and mode of transmission of coronaviruses (suspected reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 are red encircled).
                Only α and β coronaviruses have the ability to infect humans, the consumption of infected animal as a source of food is the major cause of animal to human transmission of the virus and due to close contact with an infected person, the virus is further transmitted to healthy persons.
                 Dotted black arrow shows the possibility of viral transfer from bat whereas the solid black arrow represent the confirmed transfer.
