            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome. In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death. Neurological manifestations include seizures, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome.
            Cardiovascular-related complications may include heart failure, irregular electrical activity, blood clots, and heart inflammation.In some people, COVID‑19 may affect the lungs causing pneumonia. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In those most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure. Complications associated with COVID‑19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
            Clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
            <br>
            Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID‑19 demonstrate elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
            Liver injury as shown by blood markers of liver damage is frequently seen in severe cases. </p>
