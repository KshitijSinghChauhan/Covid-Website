                    <li>Fever is the most common symptom, although some older people and those with other health problems experience fever later in the disease. In one study, 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.</li>
                    <li>Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. </li>
                    <li>Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.</li>
                    <li>Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.</li>
                    <li>Some cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations.</li>
                    <li>A decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur.</li>
                    <li>Loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea.</li>
                </ul>
                           
            <p>
                As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. 
                This is called the incubation period. The incubation period for COVIDâ€‘19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days,lthough 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. 
                <br>
                A minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time. These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not yet fully known.
                However, preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.In March 2020, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
